## LAOS Roadmap

### Goals and Objectives

The LAOS Parachain aims to provide a secure and decentralized platform for the creation, ownership, and evolution of unique digital assets. The platform will utilize the Substrate framework and enable users to easily mint, trade, and evolve their assets. In addition, the LAOS Parachain will implement a robust governance system that will enable token holders to propose and vote on changes to the protocol.

### Milestone 1 [0-3 months]
This milestone focuses on developing the LAOS ownership chain as a standalone chain, utilizing the AURA protocol for block production. The business logic for creating collections and changing asset ownership will be developed, while establishing infrastructure for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) and testing network.

* **Deliverable 1**:
* **Deliverable 2**:
* **Deliverable 3**:


### Milestone 2 [3-6 months]
The goal of this milestone is to develop the LAOS evolution chains node. The first LAOS EVOChain will be created and a light node of it will be integrated into the LAOS ownership chain via the Parity Trustless Bridge. The LAOS EVOChain will enable asset evolution for assets whose ownership stays on the LAOS ownership chain.

* **Deliverable 4**:
* **Deliverable 5**:
* **Deliverable 6**:

### Milestone 3 [6-9 months]
This milestone aims to integrate the LAOS parachain with the ROCOCO relay chain. The XC-20 protocol will be integrated to facilitate transfer of the LAOS token to sibling parachains.

* **Deliverable 7**:
* **Deliverable 8**:
* **Deliverable 9**:

### Notes

- The LAOS team follows Scrum methodology, conducting sprint cycles lasting two weeks. Regular updates on sprint progress are shared with the Substrate Builders Program team during sprint review meetings.
- The Substrate Builders Program team is invited to participate in these meetings to offer feedback and guidance on project development.
- A new release of the LAOS Parachain will be proposed at the end of each sprint, subject to stakeholder approval.
