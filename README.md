# LAOS Roadmap

## Introduction
The LAOS team will be working with SCRUM methodologies, with sprint times of 2 weeks. We believe this will help us stay focused on deliverables and keep the project on track. The Substrate Builders Program will be invited to each Sprint Review meeting to stay up to date on the project's progress. Additionally, the LAOS Parachain project will be completely open-sourced.

## Milestone 1 [0-3 months]
- Connect LAOS parachain to Rococo network with AURA authoring algorithm.
- Develop collection creation and ownership functionality.
- Implement asset ownership and URI for metadata.
- Mint LAOS token.
- Release v0.1.0 of the LAOS Parachain, following semantic versioning.

## Milestone 2 [3-6 months]
- Develop LAOS Evolution Chains to enable asset metadata evolution by collection owners.
- Ensure that asset URIs are universal locations pointing to the LAOS Evolution Chains.
- Release v0.2.0 of the LAOS Parachain.

## Milestone 3 [6-9 months]
- Implement governance functionality for LAOS Parachain.
- Enable Proof of Existence (PoE) of asset metadata on LAOS Parachain.
- Release v1.0.0 of the LAOS Parachain.

Note:
- Deliverables for each milestone should be technical and should be clearly defined.
- Regular updates on the progress of each milestone should be provided to the Substrate Builders Program to help identify any blockers and ensure that the project is on track.
- Each sprint will result in a new release of the LAOS Parachain, following semantic versioning.
